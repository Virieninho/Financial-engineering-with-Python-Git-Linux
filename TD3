## Exercise 1 : Grep and awk on tabular data
1. Display the list of files and folders at the root using ls -l
```
ls -l /
```
2. In a pipeline (using |), append a grep instruction to only display informations of bin
```
ls -l / | grep bin
```
3. Append an awk instruction to only display the size of bin
```
ls -l / | grep bin | awk '{print $5}'
```
4. Now rather extract the month, day and year of creation of the folder bin
```
ls -ld /bin | awk '{print $6, $7, $8}'
```
5. Now rearrange the instruction to get the following output format : 2020-Oct-26 (from original data : Oct 26 2020)
```
ls -ld /bin | awk '{print $8"-"$1"-"$2}'
```
## Exercise 2 : Grep with Regex, and sed on unstructured data
1. Run the following command :
```
curl https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cyberattacks > cyberattacks.txt
```
2. Use grep to extract all the lines that contain the keyword "meta"
```
grep "meta" cyberattacks.txt
```
3. Now only extract "meta" and the first following word
```
grep -o -E "meta \w+" cyberattacks.txt
```
4. Only extract the follwing word (but not the keyword "meta")
```
grep -o -E "meta \w+" cyberattacks.txt | awk '{print $2}'
```
5. Letâ€™s now try more interesting (yet complex) patterns
```
cat cyberattacks.txt | grep -A1 'id="Introduction"' | tail -n 1
grep -o -E "<title>.*</title>" cyberattacks.txt | sed -e 's/<title>//;s/<\/title>//'
grep -o -E "<h2>.*</h2>" cyberattacks.txt | sed -e 's/<[^>]*>//g'
```
